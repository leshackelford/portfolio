        <h1>Omaha Gives</h1>
            <p class=intro>
                Working at the Mission was a really great experience. Omaha Gives was a campaign that made working there so great. I got to interview some really wonderful 
                people, photograph and write their stories. Inspired by Humans of New York, I set off to hear the stories of the men below.</p>
            <p>This campaign raised $130,180 in a 24 hour period.</p>

                <h2>Daniel's Story</h2>
            <p> "My mom became very abusive, and got into drinking and drugs. I
                decided to fend for myself and got into the street life with gangs and stuff. I was going to
                school. I was actually pretty smart in school. I went to Burke High and had a 4.0 GPA,
                and played varsity soccer and all that. I was still on the streets and took good care of
                myself."
            </p>
            <p>
                "The first week I was here I really struggled because it’s faith based, and I’m full blooded
                American so I believe in my religion. So the first week I really struggled but I think it was
                really the right time because they had the “Iron Sharpens Iron” seminar, and I went to
                that. And I did something I normally don’t do, and I don’t show weakness to anyone, and
                at that seminar I broke down and cried listening to everything. And then, I started
                reading the bible and started getting more into it, and then, like I wanted to leave. I
                wanted to call my parole officer and go back to prison. I was like, I can’t do this, I don’t
                wanna do this. A couple of guys came to me and was like “Stay for the blessings. Stay,
                don’t give up”. And later that week my mom came to see me and she surprised me. She
                came with my wife and son. And now I have her back in my life and I fully surrender to
                God and everything, and everything’s been going good now. Like I don’t wake up
                depressed anymore, and don’t wake up feeling bad or anything. I feel happy. And I really
                enjoy the program. It’s really changed my life a lot."
