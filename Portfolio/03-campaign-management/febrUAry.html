        <h1>FebrUAry Campaign</h1>
            <p class=intro>I remember waking up to the news that Russia had invaded Ukraine. This hit extra hard as 
                every member of our dev team was Ukrainian. We grieved together. We cried together. Our people ops team immediately began coordinating 
                emergency evacuation plans for their loved ones. It was a very difficult time as a company. In 2024, we launched the #febrUAry campaign 
                to remind them—and the world—that they hadn’t been forgotten.</p>

    <div class="page-header-opener">
        <p>Two years ago, the world woke to the news of Russia invading Ukraine.</p>

            <p>In that moment, time stood still. Together, we mourned, we rallied, and in the difficult days to come, we supported the people of Ukraine to provide whatever support we could.</p>
            
            <p>Too soon, however, time began to move forward. News cycles slowly started reporting on other events, and day-to-day life crept back in.</p>

            <p>Time may move forward, but the needs of the Ukrainian people remain.</p>
            
            <p>At Sprious, we’re privileged to have a diverse and remarkable team dedicated to making our company the best it can be. Among our esteemed colleagues, 
                are 16 courageous, Ukrainians and their families, integral to the Sprious community.
            </p>
            
            <p>I am writing to you today to shine a light on the war that continues to rage on.</p>
            
            <p>In solidarity with the brave people of Ukraine enduring the day-to-day turmoil this war brings, we are launching our #febrUAry fundraising campaign, consisting of the following:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>GoFundMe is available for anyone to contribute a financial gift. 100% of the proceeds will go to the Ukrainian people, as described in the article linked below.</li>
                <li>Words of Support: If you’re unable to give financial support at this time, we encourage you to send notes of support directly to the email [email redacted]. Your words will make a difference!</li>
                <li>Our Own Donations: Sprious will be donating 1% of its top-line revenue (not profit!) from the month of February for this cause. By supporting Rayobyte (proxy products under the umbrella of Sprious), you are making a difference in the lives of our team.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>I encourage you to read the blog (linked below) in its entirety, as this is only a piece of the full campaign.</p>
            
            <p>While I understand this will not solve everything, I am hopeful for the difference that it will make in the lives of the Ukrainian people. I take that hope and humbly ask you to join me on this journey of life-changing impact.</p>
