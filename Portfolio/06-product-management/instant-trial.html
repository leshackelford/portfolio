        <p> The CEO & my boss came to me and shared we were having trouble gaining traction on our newest product, and asked me to do some research and share my thoughts.</p>
        
        <p>One thing to know about residential proxies, you can't just sell bandwidth outright. This creates a very unique marketing challenge. Our customers must ask us permission as residential proxies can easily be abused.
            They must wait for us to give them access. At the time, there was no automated way to do this.</p>
        
        <p>With this in mind, I did extensive research on the marketing, sales, product, onboarding etc. and noticed that we had a lot of people signing up and then would not hear back from them. Users were willing to initially 
            sign up through a form submission, but were unwilling to respond to the "what are you doing with our proxies" form... We saw a drop in 90% responses once a form was submitted and the initial questionnaire of "what are you doing with these proxies" was sent out.</p>

        <p>I pulled together my findings and proposed a self sign-up feature that we can build and effectively measure a user's progress through the onboarding process in an automated way. This also gives the user power to 
            create an account without waiting on us. We also moved the questionnaire form to the back end of the process when the user was more bought in. 
        </p>
        <p>With the help of a developer and project manager, I was able to build out an automated self-sign up feature utilizing Hubspot that increased sign ups, conversion rates and decreased our team's time in 
        back-and-forth with the customer. They could sign themselves up! Additionally, I built out a sales funnel that allowed us to see where users were falling off so we could refine our process.</p>
