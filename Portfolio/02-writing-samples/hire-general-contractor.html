            <h2>Why Hire A General Contractor</h2>

            <p>
                Being able to do things around the house yourself is a great skill to have, but one of the best skills for any do-it-yourselfer 
                is to know when not to. If you have a home project or remodel that you are considering, here are a few tips on how to decide whether to hire a general contractor.
            </p>
            
            <h2>What is a General Contractor?</h2>

            <p>
                A residential general contractor is a home renovation professional who organizes and executes larger remodeling projects. These professionals are often confused with home 
                improvement pros, but at Houston Services, we actually offer both. 
            </p>
            
            <h2>When to Hire a Home Improvement Contractor</h2>
            <p>
                Some people tend to hire a contractor when they do not need one, and others donâ€™t hire them when they should. Here are a couple quick rules to help you decide:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the job will take more than a week, hire a general contractor.</li>
                    <li>If the job requires several different professionals to complete (plumber, electrician, etc.) hire a general contractor.</li>
                    <li>If the job requires permits, hire a general contractor.</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>The Benefits of a Residential Contractor</h2>

            <p>
                A good contractor will bring you peace of mind, knowledge of industry standards, and expertise in project management. In addition, they also bring necessary requirements like a license, 
                insurances, and a warranty.
            </p>

            <p>
                With a home contractor, scheduling is not only easier, but the project is more seamless, meaning you can see the results sooner. General contractors know the order of operations, 
                so you are not having to backtrack or stumble over mistakes.
            </p>

            <p>
                General contractors also have a large network of subcontractors that they know and trust. This way, you are not having to weed through a long list of subcontractors for just 
                one piece of a home remodel. Contractors will know the right people for the right job, ultimately speeding up your project timeline. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Another great benefit to hiring a general contractor is the extra layer of protection you get if and when warranty issues arise. Any issues will be resolved more quickly and 
                easily with a general contractor. Sub-contractors, for one, have an incentive to keep the general contractor happy because it means they will get more business in the future. 
                It also prevents one contractor from blaming the other when it comes to mistakes. Lastly, general contractors will generally honor any warranty issues if the sub-contractor is no longer in business. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In the end, it is up to you to decide if your home improvement project warrants a general contractor or if you can handle the project yourself. But even if you can handle the project yourself, 
                a general contractor can remove some of the stress and worry out of the job for you!
