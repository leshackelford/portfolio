        <h1>Action Technology Brand Refresh</h1>
            <p class=intro>
                An exciting time to work at Action Technology, there have been many changes to the company's direction and vision. That is due to father handing his
                business down to son. The son wants to go a different angle by working exclusively b2b. We wanted to create some branding materials that would help 
                the company start reframing the way we approach business, and refining a brand is a great way to do that. 
            </p>
            <p>Below you will find a few materials created with marketing exclusively b2b and change management in mind.</p>

                    <p class="brand-materials-paragraph">Creating a b2b presentation was a good first step. This helped us focus on our products/services, what we offered and what we wanted to 
                        ultimately educate our community on and invite them to continue the conversation. You can find that presentation

                        identifiable on client premises, present a more professional appearance, and enable tailored access levels for employees based on their assigned clients.
