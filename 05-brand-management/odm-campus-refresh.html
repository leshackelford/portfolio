            <p class=intro>Our non-profitâ€™s CEO wanted to professionally display the mission, vision, and values throughout the campus for our 
                donors, volunteers, guests and employees. I was tasked with implementing this project from start to finish. I began by photographing scenes that best represented our mission, 
                then designed the display. Collaborating with a local printing company, I brought these designs to life and coordinated with the 
                maintenance team to install them across the campus. In addition, I was able to add these digitally to multiple platforms with the 
                hopes of inspiring both our donors and those looking to achieve sobriety. This project taught me a great deal about managing a 
                project from inception to completion.
            </p>
            <p class="intro">Inspired by the Mission, Vision and Values project, I wanted to also add verbiage that was directly for the guests who walked through the doors.</p>
            <p class="intro">At the time, I was teaching an anger management class to the women who were in the New Life Recovery Program and living at the Lydia House. One day, 
                I asked them to (anonymously) write down how the people of Open Door Mission made them feel.
            </p>
            <p class="intro">
                After class I read through the notes and then sectioned them into the three categoreies you see on the posters: You Are Loved. Your Are Valued. You Are Welcome Here. 
            </p>
            <p class="intro">I repeated the same process above to get these posters hung all over campus.</p>
