                When I was first hired on as the Brand Manager for Blazing SEO, my first big challenge was to understand Sprious' positive intention for naming their biggest product 
                a name that had little to do with proxies. I learned that using proxies for SEO was a much bigger use case back when the company was started in 2014, but 
                had lost relevance over the years. With that, I asked if we could consider re-branding to something new. The leadership team ultimately agreed and the rebranding project 
                was born. With the help of my boss and the CEO, we iterated through and picked a new name, Rayobyte, created a branding story on why we'd made the decision to change our name, and updated every 
                single piece of the company that had any Blazing SEO labeling. There was a lot of inter-departmental collaboration as this project touched everyone in the company. 
            </p>
            <p>This re-branding project led to a 50% increase in weekly traffic for the Rayobyte website.</p>
