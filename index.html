        <!--ABOUT ME SECTION-->
            <div class="about-me-section">
                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p class="about-me-p">Eight years of marketing in a number of industries has given me the opportunity to "try it all". Think social media, video, photography, writing, paid ads, SEO, email marketing, 
                    billboards, print materials, banners, postcards/various forms of mailers, website management, re-branding, campaign management, content management, internal and external communications.. The list goes on.<br>
                    <br>
                    Because of this extensive experience, I have often had interviewers, other marketers and even friends ask me what part of marketing I love the most.<br>
                    <br>
                    If I can give an honest answer, none of the marketing disciplines stick out.<br>
                    <br>
                    What sticks out to me are the people and stories I have been fortunate enough to encounter along the way. Those shared experiences and moments I would otherwise never would have had. I think of an
                    old boss I would meet for breakfast and hear his background at the IRS in Washington D.C. and his path back to Nebraska. I think of the man who was the third generation of family to have an addiciton
                    starting around the age of 10 - and him being the first in his family to seek help. I think of the re-branding from Blazing SEO to Rayoibyte and the countless hours we put into our brand communicating
                    exactly who we were and what we wanted to offer our customers. <br>
                    <br>
                    Marketing, to me, is a tool for a business to create honest, meaningful interactions with the world.
                </p>
                <p>Therefore, I live by 3 basic, but powerful marketing principles: </p>
                <p class="marketing-principles">Work Hard. Market Honest. Tell More Stories.</p>

                            <p class="project-paragraph">Before I was hired, Blazing SEO reached out to me gauging my interest in their Brand Manager position. Deciding to look into the opportunity,
                            I proceeded to do a significant amount of research on the company and industry in general. This brought me to one big conclusion: if I were to work for Blazing SEO, they would need to rebrand. </p>

                            <p class="project-paragraph">Each year, the city of Omaha would host a day of giving for the areas registered 501c(3)s. For Open Door Mission, this was always one of the biggest giving days
                               of the year and required a LOT of prep work. These projects were probably some of my favorite I ever worked on as I was able to create a vision, hear some amazing
                               stories, implement the vision based on said stories and gain SO much experience. I'm forever grateful for the opportunity.

                            <p class="project-paragraph">This was by far my favorite project I was able to work on. My CEO & boss came to me and shared we were having trouble gaining traction on our newest product, 
                                residential proxies, and asked me to do some research and share my thoughts on what I thought the problem was. Good news, I had found the problem. Hard news, it was going to take a 
                                lot of work to turn our newest product around.</p>
